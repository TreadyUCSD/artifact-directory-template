Title:
Political Misinformation on Reddit

Abstract:
In this paper, we collect posts from 28 political subreddits over a two year period and analyze the spread of misinformation in outgoing links. We categorize misinformation using a compiled list of untrustworthy domains, and use the resulting data to create networks of users and subreddits showing the spread of misinformation. Additionally, we utilize natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment of comments on posts with respect to whether the post contained misinformation. We compare our findings to a paper analyzing the spread of misinformation through twitter users.
