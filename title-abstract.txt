Title:
Political Misinformation on Reddit

Abstract:
In this project, we investigate the dissemination and characterization of misinformation spread on the online discussion site Reddit, looking specifically at a large subset of randomly selected American political subreddits using the Reddit API.

By taking advantage of Redditâ€™s hierarchical structure of subreddits, moderators, users, posts, and comments, we hope to replicate the investigation on the spread of misinformation on Twitter (from Q1) with a similar investigation on the spread of political misinformation on Reddit in the years 2020 and 2021.
